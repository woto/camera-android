# Privacy Policy for Volley Cam

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Overview
Volley Cam is an Android application designed to record volleyball games using a "dashcam" style buffering mechanism. The app allows users to join a specific "room" using a 6-digit code and record video clips triggered by game events.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1. Video and Audio Data
- **What we collect:** The app accesses your device's Camera and Microphone to record video and audio of volleyball games.
- **How it is used:** The app continuously buffers video in memory. Only when a "trigger" event occurs (initiated by you or a server signal), the relevant video segment (video and audio) is permanently saved and uploaded to our servers (`volleycam.com`).
- **Background Usage:** The app continues to record while the screen is off to preserve battery life during long games (typically 3 hours).

### 2.2. Room Identification
- **What we collect:** A 6-digit Room ID created arbitrarily by the users for their game session.
- **How it is used:** To associate uploaded clips with a specific game session.

## 3. Data Sharing and Transfer
- **Server Upload:** Recorded clips are uploaded to our secure server `volleycam.com`.
- **Encryption:** All data transfer is encrypted using standard HTTPS/WSS protocols.
- **Public Visibility:** 
    - Clips associated with a Room ID are accessible to anyone who possesses that valid 6-digit Room ID.
    - **Important:** Once a clip is "published" or uploaded, it may be publicly accessible to any user on the internet who has the correct link or Room ID. Do not use this app to record private or sensitive moments.

## 4. User Rights and Control
- **Uploading:** You have control over when the app is active and recording.
- **Deletion:** Users with access to the Room ID can manage (publish or delete) clips associated with that room.
